# Trained CNN for classification using Tensor Flow
This is my solution to project #2 of the deep learning foundations nanodegree.

To run the code, follow the instructions:


```
create env -n env_name python=3
source activate env_name
conda install numpy matplotlib pandas juypter notebook
conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow
conda install -c conda-forge tqdm=4.11.2
cd "Path of this file"
juypter notebook dlnd_image_classification.ipynb

Note: tested on mac
```
